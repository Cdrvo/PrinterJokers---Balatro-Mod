### **Printer Jokers**

**This mod introduces a fun and unique experience by adding Printer Jokers. Printer Jokers are a special type of joker that, when played, allow players to "print" the joker it represents.**

**Along with the new jokers, the mod includes a variety of decks which lets you test out every Printer Joker.**

**Of course, it adds a few original ideas of mine, instead of strictly sticking to "printing the joker it represents"**


**Currently there are 25 printer jokers with their own decks ,5 chaos jokers, 24 normal jokers, 13 new enhancements, 2 new tarots, 2 new spectral cards, 1 new seal and 2 new consumable types!**
